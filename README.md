# TSP Branch and Bound

This repo contains a straight-forward Java implementation of Branch and Bound algorithm for Travelling Salesman Problem described in IIT's [Youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nN4K8xA8ShM)

This code was written two years ago for NUS course CS2010R (which is not offered anymore now, hence safe to make the repo public).
